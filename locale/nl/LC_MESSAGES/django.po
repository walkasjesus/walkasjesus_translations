"<li>God still loved mankind. As their Creator, He continued to love them</li>\n"
"<li>God came into creation as a human to restore the relationship between God and human. He walked on earth to show people how to live. Then He died for humanity and rose again after 3 days.</li>\n"
"<li>He told his followers that He would go back to where He had come from. Just before He left, He instructed them to tell everyone that He had restored the relationship to anyone who wants to believe it. He also said that He will return when all nations have heard this good news.</li>\n"
"<li>If they believed the good news, they would receive a living spirit that would bring them into relationship with God. Then they could also understand His Word and moreover resist the temptations of the world.</li>\n"
"<li>Those who believed Him at His word began to love Him and to follow His example.</li>\n"
"<li>Through this process of discipleship, they begin to look more and more like Him, and tell others, far and near, of the good news.</li>\n"

"<li>De rechtvaardige God had tegen de mens gezegd dat als ze zouden rebelleren, dat de consequentie zou zijn dat ze zouden sterven. De mens, gemaakt naar God beeld met zijn eigen wil, rebelleerde.</li>\n"

"<li>God hield nog steeds van de mens. Als hun Maker bleef Hij van hen houden</li>\n"
"<li>God kwam in de schepping als mens om de relatie tussen God en mens te herstellen. Hij wandelde op aarde om de mens te tonen hoe te leven. Toen stierf Hij voor de mensheid en stond na 3 dagen weer op.</li>\n"
"<li>Hij vertelde zijn volgelingen, dat Hij weer terug zou gaan naar waar Hij vandaan gekomen was. Net voor Hij vertrok gaf Hij hen de opdracht om iedereen te vertellen dat Hij de relatie hersteld had voor iedereeen die het wil geloven. Ook zei Hij, dat Hij terugkomt als alle volkeren dit goede nieuws gehoord hebben.</li>\n"

"<li>Door dit proces van discipelschap, beginnen zij steeds meer op Hem te lijken, en anderen, veraf en dichtbij, van het goede nieuws te vertellen.</li>\n"

"<p><b>Everyone wants to be happy. But not everyone is willing to do what it takes to have a pure heart.</b></p>\n"
"<p>Blessed people are happy people. Those who are pure in heart are happy because they don’t let any evil into their hearts that would make them unhappy.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Instead of having a heart that is full of impurity, unthankfulness, unbelief and evil suspicions about others, these people have pure, good, and wholesome thoughts—thoughts of thankfulness and thoughts about how they can bless others. They also have a firm, uncompromising resistance in their hearts to any thoughts of selfishness, impurity, doubt and anxiety that might try to come in.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h5>How do I become pure in heart and keep it that way?</h5>\n"
"<p>You could talk to a hundred people on the street and not find a single person who doesn’t want to be happy. But not everyone is willing to do what it takes to be pure in heart. Getting a pure heartHaving a pure heart means that you do not agree with any sinful or impure thoughts that come up in you, but rather you deny these thoughts and put them to death. It means that you are not affected or tainted by sin on ... and keeping it doesn’t happen by accident. To get a pure heart I have to put my life in order with God and people and ask for forgiveness when necessary. But purity isn’t meant to stop there.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>It is written in Psalm 119:9, “How can a young man keep his way pure? By taking heed according to Your word.” God’s Word is the instruction manual for helping me to keep my heart pure all my life. It is not complicated to begin living a pure life. For a start, think about taking just one simple verse and obeying that, like this verse in 1 Thessalonians 5:18, “In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.”</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Think how happy I will be in one month if I am thankful in everything! How about one year later? 10 years later? Imagine the end of a long life with a pure heart that is full of thankfulness, where I’ve started out making the right choices while I’m young!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In all of life’s circumstances I have to make choices about how I react to other people, what I do with my free time, and what thoughts I allow to occupy my mind. Obeying God’s Word gives me a direction for my life and helps me make the right choices in all of the situations I meet.</p>"

"<p>Als je honderd mensen op straat zou aanspreken, zou je niet één persoon vinden die niet gelukkig wil zijn. Maar niet iedereen is bereid om te doen wat nodig is om een rein hart te krijgen.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Zalige mensen zijn gelukkige mensen. Zij die een rein hart hebben, zijn gelukkig omdat ze geen kwade gedachten in hun hart toelaten die hen ongelukkig kunnen maken.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In plaats van een hart te hebben vol onreinheid, ondankbaarheid, ongeloof of slechte gedachten over een ander, hebben deze mensen reine, goede, gezonde gedachten, en bedenken zij hoe ze tot zegen kunnen zijn voor een ander.  Ze hebben ook een vast, compromisloos verzet in hun hart tegen alle egoïstische, onreine, gedachten en gedachten van twijfel en bezorgdheid die mochten proberen om binnen te komen.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<h5>Hoe krijg (en houd) ik een rein hart?</h5>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Als je honderd mensen op straat zou aanspreken, zou je niet één persoon vinden die niet gelukkig wil zijn. Maar niet iedereen is bereid om te doen wat nodig is om een rein hart te krijgen. Een rein hart krijgen, en houden, gebeurt niet toevallig. Om een rein hart te krijgen moet ik mijn leven in orde hebben met God en de mensen en om vergeving vragen als dat nodig is. Maar het is niet de bedoeling dat de reinheid daar stopt.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Er staat geschreven in Psalm 119:9: “Waarmee zal de jongeling zijn pad rein bewaren? Als hij het houdt naar Uw woord.” Gods woord is de handleiding om mij te helpen mijn hart rein te bewaren, mijn hele leven lang. Het is niet ingewikkeld om te beginnen met een rein leven te leiden. Om te starten kun je heel simpel één vers nemen en daar gehoorzaam aan zijn, zoals dit vers in 1 Thess. 5:18: “Dankt onder alles! Want dat is de wil Gods in Christus Jezus ten opzichte van u”. Bedenk eens hoe gelukkig ik zal zijn als ik een maand lang dankbaar ben voor alles! En een jaar later? Tien jaar later? Denk je eens in hoe het zal zijn aan het einde van een lang leven met een rein hart dat vol is van dankbaarheid als ik begonnen ben om de juiste keuzes te maken als ik jong ben!</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>In alle situaties in mijn leven moet ik keuzes maken, hoe ik reageer op andere mensen, wat ik doe in mijn vrije tijd, welke gedachten mogen mijn geest in beslag  nemen. Gehoorzamen aan Gods woord geeft mij richting in mijn leven en helpt mij om de juiste keuzes te maken in alle situaties die ik tegenkom.</p>"

"<p>Who does not know the story of the prodigal son? The question is: do we know the Hebrew culture? The story has more meanings that we miss because we don't know the culture. Too bad right? For example, asking for the annoyance before the person died was like saying, \"Dad, you're dead to me.\" When after his wanderings and brasseries the son came home stinkingly unclean - because of the pigs - the father ran up to the son and embraced him. \"Terrible,\" the bystanders would have said. But probably for a different reason than you think. The reasons are:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>A father does not run, for he must lift his garment and uncover his shame (ankles)</li>\n"
"<li>The father embraces an unclean person and therefore becomes unclean and unworthy. What is happening here is that the attention is shifted from the son's shame and uncleanness to the father's shame, uncleanness and unworthiness.</li>\n"
"<li>The father then gives the son the best dress, ring and shoes. You might think nothing special. Well, that says a lot in that culture.</li>\n"
"<ol type=\"1\">\n"
"<li>The best robe represents the dignity of the father.</li>\n"
"<li>The ring represents the father's power of attorney.</li>\n"
"<li>The shoes for the father's possession.</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>In summary: The father takes the son's shame and impurity, and the son receives the dignity, power of attorney and wealth from the father. Wow, what an image of God. And we haven't even mentioned the eldest son and the slaves in this parable.</p>"

"<p>Wie kent dit verhaal niet. De vraag is alleen: kennen we de Hebreeuwse cultuur? Het verhaal heeft meer betekenissen die ons ontgaan omdat we de cultuur niet kennen. Jammer toch? Zo was het vragen om de ergenis voordat de persoon overleden was net zoiets als zeggen: \"Pa, voor mij ben je dood.\" Toen de zoon na zijn omzwervingen en brasserijen stinkend onrein - vanwege de varkens - thuiskwam, rende de vader op de zoon af en omhelsde hem. \"Vreselijk,\" zouden de omstanders gezegd hebben. Maar waarschijnlijk om een andere reden dan je denkt. De redenen zijn:</p>\n"
"<ul>\n"
"<li>Een vader rent niet, want daarvoor moet hij zijn kleed optillen en zijn schaamte (enkels) ontbloten</li>\n"
"<li>De vader omarmt een onrein mens en wordt daaroor ook zelf onrein en onwaardig. Wat hier gebeurt, is dat de aandacht van de schaamte en onreinheid van de zoon, naar de schaamte, onreinheid en ontwaardigheid van de vader wordt verlegd.</li>\n"
"<li>Vervolgens geeft de vader de zoon het beste kleed, een ring en schoenen. Niets bijzonders denk je misschien. Nou, in die cultuur zegt dat heel veel.</li>\n"
"<ol type=\"1\">\n"
"<li>Het beste kleed staat voor de waardigheid van de vader.</li>\n"
"<li>De ring staat voor de volmacht van de vader.</li>\n"
"<li>De schoenen voor het bezit van de vader.</li>\n"
"</ol>\n"
"<p>Samengevat: De vader neemt de schaamte en onreinheid van de zoon, en de zoon krijgt de waardigheid, de volmacht en de rijkdom van de vader. Wauw, wat een beeld van God. En dan hebben we het nog niet gehad over de oudste zoon en de slaven in deze gelijkenis.</p>"

"<p> In Luke 12:35-40, Jesus begins to gird up your loins and have the lamp burning. He then called on to be vigilant and ready for the arrival of the Son of Man.</p>\n"

"<p>We hardly know the word loin today. A loincloth is a piece of clothing that consists only of a cotton cloth that is worn around the loins - the hips. The loins are the center of your body. The Hebrew expression \"the loins girded\" has more to do with a tunic, an undergarment. If something had to be done quickly, the tunic was tied around the loins with a leather belt. It was a starting position of someone who had to take action. In the East, both men and women wore long clothes that reached the feet. The rug was held up with the belt, so that the feet and legs had more freedom of movement. When girdling the loins, the long overcoat was taken up and put into the belt, or pulled up by the belt, when preparing to do work or travel. </p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Someone who pulls up his long clothing and ties it around his loins with a belt, so he can move quickly. The Israelites had to be ready in the night of their departure from Egypt, the loins girded in order to be able to leave immediately. (Exodus 12:11). Elijah girded his loins to rush out for Ahab (1 Kings 18:46). We must also be ready to expect the arrival of the Son of Man at all times. </p>\n"

"<p>In Lukas 12:35-40 begint Jezus om je lendenen te omgorden en de lamp brandend te hebben. Vervolgens roept hij op om waakzaam te zijn en paraat te staan voor de komst van de Mensenzoon.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Het woord lendenen kennen wij vandaag nauwelijks meer. Een lendendoek is een kledingstuk dat slechts bestaat uit een katoenen lap die om de lendenen - de heupen- wordt gedragen. De lendenen zijn het midden van je lichaam. De Hebreeuwse uitdrukking ‘ de lendenen omgord’ heeft meer te maken met een tunica, een onderkleed. Als men vlug iets moest doen dan werd die tunica met een leren gordel opgebonden rond de lendenen. Het was een starthouding van iemand die in actie moest komen. In het Oosten droegen zowel mannen als vrouwen lange kleren, die tot de voeten reikten. Met de gordel werd het kleed opgehouden, zodat de voeten en benen meer bewegingsvrijheid hadden. Bij het omgorden van de lendenen werd het lange overkleed opgenomen en in de gordel gestoken, of door de gordel omhoog getrokken, als men zich voorbereidde om werk te verrichten of te reizen.</p>\n"
"\n"
"<p>Iemand die zijn lange kleding omhoog trekt en het met een gordel om zijn lendenen vastbindt, die kan zich dus snel verplaatsen. De Israëlieten moesten in de nacht van hun vertrek uit Egypte zo klaar staan, de lendenen omgord, om direct te kunnen vertrekken. (Exodus 12:11). Elia omgordde zijn lendenen om zo voor Achab uit te snellen (l Koningen 18:46). Zo moeten wij ook klaarstaan om de komst van de Mensenzoon ten alle tijden te verwachten.</p>\n"
